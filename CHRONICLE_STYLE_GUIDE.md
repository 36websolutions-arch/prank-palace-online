## Chronicle Style (Current Format)

### Structure
1. **Roman Narrative (70%)** - Fictional story set entirely in Ancient Rome
2. **"THE PARALLEL" Section** - Explicit jump to modern day ("Two thousand years later...")
3. **Devastating Kicker** - Quiet realization that lingers

### Tone
- Sharp, understated, slightly nihilistic
- Dry wit, NOT slapstick
- Deadpan absurdity - treating mundane modern horrors with historical gravitas
- Humor comes from the GAP between what's said and what's meant

### Key Elements
- Meetings = military campaigns
- Performance reviews = public executions
- Layoffs = purges / lions
- CEOs = Emperors
- The last person who didn't applaud was fed to the lions during a "culture realignment exercise"

### Ending Style
End with a quiet but devastating realization. Examples:
- "You open LinkedIn. 'Looking for opportunities in specialized gladiator combat,' you type."
- "The next all-hands is scheduled for Thursday. Attendance is mandatory. Enthusiasm is expected. Comprehension remains, as always, optional."

## Instagram Caption Style (@corporatepranks)

### Structure
1. **Modern Hook** - Commentary on a video/current event (observational, relatable)
2. **Cultural Critique** - Deep dive into what's broken (dating, internet culture, loyalty, etc.)
3. **Roman Parallel** - Historical lesson with REAL Roman figures (Cincinnatus, Cato, Clodius Pulcher, Augustus)
4. **"The Prank" Kicker** - Devastating closing that reframes everything

### Tone
- Social commentary with irony (serious, not comedy)
- Genuine cultural criticism with teeth
- Modern observation FIRST, then Rome as evidence

### Key Phrases
- "That's the prank here..."
- "The prank is thinking..."
- "And Rome's lesson is simple..."
- "Empires don't fall overnight. They rot slowly, from the inside out."

### Real Historical Figures Used
- **Cincinnatus** - Didn't posture or perform. Acted when needed, returned to real life when done.
- **Cato the Elder** - Preached discipline and virtue in public and private life.
- **Clodius Pulcher** - Weaponized outrage, stirred masses, turned civic discourse into chaos.
- **Augustus** - Tried to restore traditional family values because he knew societies collapse when households collapse.

## Writing Tips

### For Chronicles
1. Start in Rome - immerse the reader immediately
2. Use Roman vocabulary consistently (The Aether, not The Cloud)
3. Make the satire discoverable - don't spell out the joke
4. Bring back recurring characters for continuity
5. End quiet, not loud - the horror should settle in slowly

### For Instagram
1. Hook with something relatable and current
2. Build the cultural critique with specific observations
3. Bring in Rome as EVIDENCE, not allegory
4. Land the "prank" - make them feel the irony
5. Leave them thinking about it for hours
