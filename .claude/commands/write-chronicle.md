# Chronicle Writing Skill

Generate a new Corporate Chronicle following these guidelines. The Corporate Chronicle is a satirical series that draws parallels between the Roman Empire and modern corporate culture.

## Style Requirements

- **Roman Empire parallel**: Every story uses ancient Rome as a lens to critique modern corporate culture
- **Satirical/dark humor tone**: The humor should be sharp but not mean-spirited, exposing absurdity through exaggeration
- **Narrative structure with dialogue**: Stories are dialogue-heavy with vivid characters
- **Modern workplace parallel section**: Include a section (after "---") that explicitly connects to modern office life
- **Length**: 1500-2000 words
- **Ending**: Always end with "The Corporate Chronicle / Satire Since Rome"

## Character Archetypes

| Roman | Corporate Equivalent |
|-------|---------------------|
| Gladiators | Employees |
| Senate/Senators | Board/Executives/Leadership |
| Arena/Colosseum | Office/Workplace |
| Emperor/Caesar | CEO |
| Centurions | Middle Management |
| Slaves | Interns/Entry-level |
| Consuls | C-Suite Executives |
| Provincial Manager | Direct Manager |
| Forum | All-Hands Meeting |
| Scrolls | Emails/Slack/Documentation |
| Denarii | Salary/Bonuses |
| Lions | Layoffs/PIPs |

## Structure Template

1. **Opening scene** (Roman setting): Establish the protagonist and their situation
2. **Conflict/incident**: Something absurd happens that mirrors corporate dysfunction
3. **Dialogue revealing absurdity**: Let characters speak the corporate doublespeak in Roman terms
4. **Section break** (---): Transition moment
5. **Escalation**: The situation gets worse in predictable corporate fashion
6. **Modern workplace parallel** (after "THE PARALLEL" header): Explicit connection to today's office life
7. **Resolution/non-resolution**: Often the system wins, but awareness is gained
8. **Closing reflection**: Social commentary on participation and choice
9. **Sign-off**: "The Corporate Chronicle / Satire Since Rome"

## Topic Rotation List

Use one of these corporate phenomena as your starting point:

1. **All-Hands Meetings** - Mandatory attendance, empty announcements, forced enthusiasm
2. **Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)** - The bureaucratic path to termination
3. **Team Building Exercises** - Mandatory fun, trust falls, escape rooms
4. **Annual Reviews** - Arbitrary metrics, stack ranking, grade inflation/deflation
5. **The Open Office Plan** - No privacy, "collaboration," hot desking
6. **Synergy Initiatives** - Meaningless mergers of teams/projects
7. **The New Employee** - Onboarding, drinking the Kool-Aid, early disillusionment
8. **The Reorg Announcement** - Musical chairs with titles, same problems
9. **Mandatory Training** - Compliance videos, sexual harassment modules, "voluntary" certifications
10. **The Exit Interview** - The final performance, burning bridges vs. staying silent
11. **The Town Hall Q&A** - Pre-screened questions, non-answers, "parking lot" items
12. **The Pizza Party** - Celebration during crisis, food as compensation
13. **The Unlimited PTO Policy** - The trap of "unlimited" time off
14. **The Return to Office Mandate** - Hybrid negotiations, desk booking, commute theater
15. **The Company Values Poster** - Words vs. reality, "we're a family"

## Tone Examples

**Good** (sharp but empathetic):
> "The crowd applauded. Not because they felt applause, but because the last man to not applaud had been fed to the lions during a 'culture realignment exercise.'"

**Good** (absurdist corporate speak):
> "I'm marking this as 'needs improvement in stakeholder communication.' You'll receive a formal PIP — a Performance Improvement Parchment."

**Avoid** (too cynical/bitter):
> "Everyone in corporate is evil and stupid."

**Avoid** (too preachy):
> "This is why capitalism is fundamentally broken..."

## Output Format

Return the full story text ready for insertion into the blogs table or as a new page component. Include:

1. `STORY_TITLE` - The chronicle title
2. `STORY_SUBTITLE` - Always "A Chronicle from the Corporate Empire"
3. `STORY_PREVIEW` - First ~500 words (stopping at a compelling moment)
4. `STORY_FULL` - Complete story including preview content

## Example Opening

```
The horn sounded at the third hour.

Every citizen of Rome knew what it meant: [corporate event]. Attendance was mandatory. Enthusiasm was expected. Comprehension was optional.

[Protagonist name] shuffled into the [location] with [number] other [worker types]. The [seating arrangement description] — [hierarchy joke].
```

## Writing Process

1. **Choose a topic** from the rotation list (or accept user input)
2. **Identify the core absurdity** - What makes this corporate ritual ridiculous?
3. **Create a Roman parallel** - How would this look in ancient Rome?
4. **Develop a protagonist** - Give them a name, a survival strategy, a perspective
5. **Write the Roman narrative** - Let the satire emerge from the situation
6. **Write the modern parallel** - Make the connection explicit and painful
7. **End with a choice** - Remind readers that participation is optional

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Does it make you laugh uncomfortably?
- [ ] Would someone who works in an office recognize themselves?
- [ ] Is the Roman parallel internally consistent?
- [ ] Does the dialogue sound like real corporate speak translated to Latin concepts?
- [ ] Is there a clear "THE PARALLEL" section connecting to modern life?
- [ ] Does it end with the sign-off?
